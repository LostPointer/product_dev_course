"""Background worker: flush spooled telemetry batches to PostgreSQL.

The worker runs as a long-lived asyncio task.  On each tick it:
1. Lists all spool files in chronological order (oldest first).
2. Tries to replay each file via ``TelemetryIngestService._flush_spool_record``.
3. Deletes successfully replayed files.
4. Stops the current cycle on the first ``asyncpg.PostgresError`` — if the DB
   is still unavailable there is no point trying the remaining files.

Corrupted spool files (JSON parse error, unexpected schema) are renamed to
``.bad`` to avoid blocking the queue indefinitely.
